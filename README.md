# BasicWeatherWebAppExample

## Introduction
This is my first attempt to build a web application from scratch, that's why I chose a simple and common concept. 
It is supposed to work as a template for future more complex projects. The application will consist of a web page with 
a search bar that presents the current weather data for the selected area (propably by city name).

## Technical Characteristics
For the development of this web app I am going to use the Django framework (Python-Based) and the following programming and markup languages:
 - Python
 - HTML

in the Visual Studio Code environment.

The weather APIs I'll use are from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Instructions for running the app on your device
Here I will give some information on how to organize this project on a virtual environment (pipenv or pyvenv) and run the app on a local server.
It is required to have installed Python and pip.

### THE WEB APP IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT - NEW FILES ARE TO BE ADDED SOON!
