# BasicWeatherWebAppExample

## Introduction
This is my first attempt to build a web application from scratch, that's why I chose a simple and common concept. 
It is supposed to work as a template for future more complex projects. The application will consist of a web page with 
a search bar that presents the current weather data for a selected area (propably by city name).

## Technical Characteristics
For the development of this web app I am going to use the Django framework (Python-Based) and the following programming and markup languages:
 - Python
 - HTML(with internal CSS usage)

in the Visual Studio Code environment.

Weather APIs by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## How to use the web app
Since you can run the app and opened it on your browser (locally) you will see the page with its welcoming form:

Next you can type in the searchbar the name of the city or village you want to view the weather for. The app returns the data 
with the same page-adress, with a slightly modified form. It should appear like the example bellow that showed up after searching the weather for 
'Thessaloniki':

In case you search an address that doesn't exist locally (e.g.: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/secondweatherpage') you will view a custom Error 404 page.
If you type two separate words in the searchbar (e.g.: 'Hong Kong') or a name for which data cannot be provided (e.g.: a false name such as 'KongHong' or the name of a tiny village) or you typed in a language other than English a custom Error 500 page will emerge with a few instructions.


## Instructions for running the app on your device
Here I will give some information on how to organize this project on a virtual environment (pipenv or pyvenv) and run the app on a local server.
It is required to have installed Python and pip.
